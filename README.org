* Introduction

This repo contains emacs lisp code, to add the possibility
to accept email invitations within  notmuch. 

The file was found at
- https://github.com/larkery/emacs-bankruptcy/blob/master/site-lisp/notmuch-calendar-x.el

which was not working out of the box at emacs 27. I changed some part so it works at least 
to capture invitations in an own emacs org file (specified by notmuch-calendar-capture-target).

* Working parts

The following parts are working as by my observations

- showing the invitatioin and showing the day of the event as an agenda overview
- capture invitations from emails within notmuch
- sending invitations from an org-mode event (by M-x notmuch-calendar-send-org-invitation)


* Not sure if it works

- acceptance of invitations (at the moment an email is opened with the reply, 
  but I have not tested, if this is working correctly, when I send it
  
- rejecting an invitation, newer tried it jet

- tentative for an invitation
